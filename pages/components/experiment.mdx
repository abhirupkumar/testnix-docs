# Experiment

The ```<Experiment />``` component is used to wrap a set of ```<Variant />``` components. It will render one of the variants at random, unless the visitor is a returning visitor. In that case, the previously shown variant will be displayed again within a 24-hour period.

When a variant is selected and displayed to your visitor, the ```<Experiment />``` component sends an event to the analytics server known as an impression.
